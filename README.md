Yahtzee is a repository I'm working on to practice Docker and Go. 

My goal is to make a host docker container which can allow 'player' containers
to connect and compete against each other in a game. Each player will use a protocol buffer library 
to communicate with the host. Players can be implemented in different languages and 
use different algorithms to make decisions.
